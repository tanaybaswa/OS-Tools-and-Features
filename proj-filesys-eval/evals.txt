Jaeden Quintana|12|20|Took care of the buffer cache (both the document and code implementation). Helped to the integrate the code and all its sections. Attended zoom meeting and was responsive over group text. Was open to help others. Overall, the group communicated reasonably well, and mostly everyone performed their tasks to a good level in a timely manner. For this reason, I must give everyone in the group 20. This is an equal amount and fair.
