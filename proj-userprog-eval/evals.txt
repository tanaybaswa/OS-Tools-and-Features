Jaeden Quintana|12|20|Took care of argument passing and I think he also worked on process syscalls with Ashley. Also worked on debugging some tests that his code was failing, as well as other failing tests overall. I sometimes felt that his pace of working was quite fast, which is of course a great quality, but sometimes made it feel like he was doing more work than the others, even if that was not intended from the group. Overall, the group had decided to evenly split the project based on the 4 tasks, and everyone managed to do their section to completion. This is why I should give everyone 20. 
Lisa Ye|106|20|Took care of file syscalls (both the document and code). Also worked on debugging some tests that her code was failing. Overall, the group had decided to evenly split the project based on the 4 tasks, and everyone managed to do their section to completion. This is why I should give everyone 20. This split also applied to the report and debugging. 
Ashley Park|20|20|Took care of process control syscalls (both the document and code). Also worked on debugging some tests that her code was failing. Also wrote additional tests that we needed for the final report.  Overall, the group had decided to evenly split the project based on the 4 tasks, and everyone managed to do their section to completion. This is why I should give everyone 20. This split also applied to the report, debugging, and the concept check.
